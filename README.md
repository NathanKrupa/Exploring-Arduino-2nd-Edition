_Exploring Arduino:_ 2nd Edition
================================
_These are the code files that accompany the 2nd Edition of the [*Exploring Arduino* book](https://www.exploringarduino.com) by [Jeremy Blum](https://www.jeremyblum.com)_  
  
These are the most up-to-date versions of the code examples provided within the 2nd Edition book. If you have the 1st Edition of the book, please visit the [1st Edition GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sciguy14/Exploring-Arduino).  
  
All of the code within the book is tested and confirmed to work with the provided example scenarios. However, I may choose to make improvements or adjustments to the code over time. When I make changes, they will always be available for download here. Futhermore, changes that I commit to this GitHub repository will automatically be zipped and pushed to the [Exploring Arduino Website](https://www.exploringarduino.com/content2).  For those unfamiliar with GitHub or git version control, I recommend that you visit the Exploring Arduino Website to download zip files containing the code for each chapter in this book.
